Collection of BASH Functions

I load these up in my own shell environment.

At this time, they are all ones I've written, and will stay mostly that way.

Some depend on others, but many are stand-alone.

If they're useful for anyone else, then great! :)

Any functions that become their own project or script will most likely show up in their own repo at::
